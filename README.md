# Primary Concerns and Requirements for Lead Mapping 

1. Single Pairing: Each Lead can only be paired with one RM at a time.
2. Multiple Leads per RM: An RM can be paired with multiple Leads as long as they are available.
3. Availability Tracking: The availability score of an RM is a range from 0 to 10, with 0 being unavailable and 10 being most available. This is reduced by 1 after each successful pairing.
4. Expertise Matching: Only RMs with expertise matching the Lead's product to pitch are considered.
5. Distance Preference: The closest RM is preferred when pairing.
6. Unpaired Leads List: If no suitable RM is found for a Lead, it is added to a separate list along with a reason.
7. Reason for Pairing: For each successful pairing, a reason is provided explaining why that pairing was made.
